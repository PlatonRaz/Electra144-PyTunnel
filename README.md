# Electra 144-PyTunnel

## Introduction

**Electra 144-PyTunnel** is a Python-based implementation of the steady-state thermal rating calculations for underground cable tunnels. The methodology is based on the **Electra No. 144** technical reference (CIGRÃ‰, 1992). This tool models heat transfer in a circular tunnel environment and performs numerical simulations using an iterative convergence approach.


- This tool performs a numerical steady-state simulation and visualisation to support engineering analysis of tunnel heat transfer performance.
- This is an independent computational implementation and is not affiliated with or endorsed by CIGRE or the authors of Electra 144.

## Features

- Iterative steady-state calculation of thermal tunnel performance against tunnel length or air velocity using Electra 144.

- Graphical User Interface (GUI) for input control and result display.
